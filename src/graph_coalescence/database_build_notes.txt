To build the redis db, log into robokopdev.renci.org

Find where the neo4j you want is running with: kubectl -n translator-robokop get pods -o wide

Get the bolt (7687) port with: kubectl -n translator-robokop get svc

With those two pieces of information, you can launch cypher shell (you know the password):

cypher-shell -a stars-k6.edc.renci.org:31333 -u neo4j -p XXXXXXXXX

NOTE, you should probably do this in a screen, it takes a long time to run.

Insure APOC is installed (it should be by default) and then you can run in the shell:

WITH "MATCH path = (a)-[x]->(b)
      RETURN a.id AS source_id, labels(a) AS source_labels, type(x) AS predicate,
             b.id AS target_id, labels(b) AS target_labels" AS query
      CALL apoc.export.csv.query(query, "everything.csv", {})
      YIELD file, source, format, nodes, relationships, properties, time, rows, batchSize, batches, done, data
      RETURN file, source, format, nodes, relationships, properties, time, rows, batchSize, batches, done, data;

The path there is local to the database.  /data is mounted on arrival, so you can find everything.csv in
/mnt/stars-k-nfs/opt/robokop/neo4j_data on that machine.

Building the redis is a 2 step process.  It required a bit of memory, so I have been using a hatteras node like
sinteractive -m 32000

scp the data
scp whoever@arrival.edc.renci.org:/mnt/stars-k-nfs/opt/robokop/neo4j_data/everything.csv

python build_redis_files.py

Stand up an empty redis server.  The load code is going assume it's on localhost:6379 with no password.

python load_redis.py

When done, there will be a dump.rdb file.  This can now be fed to the production redis.
